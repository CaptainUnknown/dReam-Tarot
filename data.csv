The Fool,"The first and last card of the Tarot, this card represents the querent or you. Well, all of us really. It is a reminder to zoom out dimensionally to access all the levels of our being.  When The Fool makes his way through the lessons, initiations, tests and victories of the Major Arcana, he finally reaches his fullest attainment, enlightenment/Mt.Meru/Agartha/Polaris etc. This comes in the form of Union with the Grandest Beloved(God).  From there, once he has achieved this mastery, he may choose to forget everything he ever knew and start the journey at the beginning level to play the Game of Life once again, or he can maintain his mastery and life in the world while being clearly not of it. The entire world views him as a fool, either being the master perceived as mad by the sleeping masses, or a brand-new soul: asleep in the game, a new fractal of Creator waiting to be programmed.  Either way, he is a fool, carefree and jolly, silly and ravenously mad to the outside world.  The Fool reminds us to view every soul as a master, no matter how sleepy or sheepy they may seem, even if they are following mindlessly in the humdrum of the collective hypnosis. We may not know what they have already achieved or if they have chosen to forget it all and play the game again. We must trust people even when they make decisions that we believe are silly. We must honor each person’s self-possession and mastery, even when we don’t understand it.  This card encourages us to get a bird’s eye perspective (dimensionally speaking) and to realize not everyone nor everything is as it seems.  Honor the divinity within all. Embrace the Mystery.  We do not yet know all. ",Fool,0,13,1,The Major Arcana
The Magician,"Originally “Le Bateleur” in the Marseilles deck, this is the first proper lesson and initiation on our journey together. Consider this the base line programming that we get when we drop into this realm as a baby. Every brand-new soul comes in with basic programming that is force-fed either through school or media, the generic collective consciousness that everyone receives by default. This card represents learning and mastering all the mundane third dimensional aspects of existence in the “normal world”. The Fool has learned to navigate the sea of basic human life, and yet something feels amiss. This is the stage in which awakening can take place, the alchemical fires within him stir, he looks out into “reality” to see that not all is as he’s been told. The search for occult Truth begins to take shape within himself as he becomes increasingly jaded with the world view he was given. This is 12 the stage when the seed activates and attempts to burst out of the confines of the it’s husk. The intelligence of the seed knows something grander is out there but cannot quite perceive what it is. The confines of this formerly protective shell while the seed was dormant now feels like a prison to the awakening consciousness craving to expand beyond it. Deep despair grows as the juxtaposition begins to become more extreme. This feeling will soon become a catalyst for growth on his journeys into the dark night of the soul.",Magician,I ,3,3,The Major Arcana
The High Priestess,"The dark night of the soul commences, a journey into the watery world of illusion and discovery of Truth. Herein also, a glimmer of hope buds as we become more in tune and aware of our spiritual nature as symbolized by the lotus. We begin to learn and discover the power of our soul’s hidden wisdom that whispers to us only in the stillness of the mind and a calm beating heart. The search expands into seeking in the dark, like the seedling that has finally broken through the seed husk and must now navigate its way through the moist, dark layers of soil to get to the sun. The Fool begins to experiment from the inside with their direct effects on this sacred construct we call reality. What are the boundaries where The Fool ends and the external ‘reality’ begins? What effects can be created? What is Truth? What is no 14 longer serving our identity of self? The Fool integrates the cognitive dissonance and masterfully dispels all that no longer stands on its own.",Priestess,II,9,2,The Major Arcana
The Empress,"The performance card of the journey, and the first official victory having passed through the dark night of the soul in the previous cards, The Empress represents mastery of manifestation, allowing oneself to craft and birth in life goals with artistry and efficiency. The Empress represents a time where we are nurturing our spiritual side and connection to The Divine. This is our first victory and flowstate where miraculous blessings are being showered over us. Auspicious indeed, and perhaps also a bit indulgent, but The Divine smiles on her gratitude for each one of the blessings bestowed. Her faith in co-creation brings The Divine sheer bliss to watch her radiance in action. Creating the way intended, with unbridled abandon, overcoming previously unimaginable obstacles. For a moment, she sits invincible and unrivaled in the power of the Universe.",Empress,III,4,3,The Major Arcana
The Emperor,"As The Fool walks his journey, the pendulum must balance out. Spending so much time in the exquisiteness of The Divine Feminine mystery, we come into a lesson or a sort of practice phase, the opposite side of The Empress, but equivalent in nature. Now we are focused on growing our potency and power via logic and reason. The last two Major Arcana were a two-part inhale, and this card represents the beginning of the exhale. We come down off the proverbial mountain where we fasted and hid ourselves away in a cave to get closer to The Divine, and now, we rejoin society reborn with our new etheric skills we have learned. However, in this phase, we must forget them just temporarily to capitalize on the Alchemical osmotic potential. Now we can swing deeper into The Father and Emperor archetype to align with all the lessons 17 heretofore. This is a time of integration of your spiritual skills into action in the mundane world of commerce and business.",Emperor,IV,4,3,The Major Arcana
The Hierophant,"Originally called “Le Pope” in the Tarot de Marseilles, this card symbolizes the integrations of both lower-level Masculine/Feminine and the higher levels as well. We’ve integrated our mundane skills in both polarities with the spiritual skills for both masculine and feminine aspects of self. This is the perfect balance and harmony of all the skills in the Major Arcana up to this point, yet this card is slightly more masculine in nature. The Hierophant is the embodiment of a spiritually awakened man. Think of all the juicy qualities of an alpha male but tempered through a lens of the wolf who leads the pack from the rear of the pack, not out of fear and haste, but out of a harmonious respect that can only come from authentic connection to Source. Things are easy, gentle and powerful in the river of life. Careful of remaining here for too long—it is 19 easy to get caught in this phase and lose the natural balance of Alchemical polarity. Continue the journey of The Fool to avoid stagnancy.",Hierophant,V,3,3,The Major Arcana
The Lovers,"At first glance, the twin-souled Lovers appear to be walking through the sea into the sun during an eclipse, signifying the Union of the Light and the Dark within. At closer reflection what they are walking into is the Black sun, or the sun of the first realm, Mercury. This card represents the moment in our life when we are in total symbiosis with our inner polarities. This harmonic resonance is reflected by the grand external fractal, harmonizing the Beloved within and the Beloved without. In a more practical sense, it can absolutely symbolize a Divine Union with another, but it comes with the profound message of The Grand Beloved, fusing you into an amalgamation of its Love from every angle of your perception. You’re being offered this frequency to tap into it now. Do not reject The One whose heart only beats 21 for your ultimate bliss. Can you find the Alchemical Union within yourself?",Lovers,VI,9,2,The Major Arcana
The Chariott,"After reaching the euphoric heights of The Lovers, we now come back down to Aerthe a bit and begin to manifest action. This card represents victories and boundaries. This could be in the mundane sense of exerting firm boundaries to ensure your success as well as exploring the mystery of where your creative boundaries end and those of The Divine begin. This card has subtle references to card X (The Wheel of Fortune), with both the X in the image and the wheel as we begin to create momentum in our manifestations—the discovery between our impacts on creation and destiny continues. Are we indeed creating everything around us if the Grand Beloved has united with our very essence, or are we simply experiencing Karma, or Destiny? The horse-like entities are a synthesis of both the light (consciousness) and 23 the dark (unconscious) within us, which is used as a catalyst to our goals, propelling us through equal parts unresolved ego and trauma and the taste of Divine Union, Waheguru, that came to us in card 6. Yet, the quest must go on. Can you pinpoint the boundary where you end and Creator’s creation begins? Or are you going to crawl back in your shell, overwhelmed by the illusion of “other” and protect yourself in the dark unconscious and the unformed?",Chariott,VII,3,3,The Major Arcana
Justice,"This is the stage in the journey where we are operating in perfect balance; our manifestations are falling at our feet nearly faster than we can adjust to. So we taper back and begin to explore the morality of desire and creation. We get in touch with the deeper values that can only be pondered when we have attained the mastery of all the cards that have come before this one. We study the morality between our choices and our desires, and perhaps decide that though we wield massive power, we refrain from using it as we desire to return to a simpler trickle of life. We don the helmet of a light warrior, connected directly to Source, yet stay in utter peace and balance through non-action, becoming stewards of this immense power, but disciplined like a highly trained Shaolin Monk, being careful not to use it out of alignment with our highest integrity in order to maintain the delicate balance of the scales of nature.",Justive,VIII,4,3,The Major Arcana
The Hermit,"Ruled by Virgo, which is also the sign of Lord Hanuman in the Vedas, you see a Monkey God/Monk levitating with a double halo. The Hermit may have at one point represented the act of isolating oneself in remote areas, but in the higher interpretation more applicable to today’s world, it means an isolation from external influences, or rather, the generic version of reality we all are given. This is a symbolic type of isolation that breeds nonreaction, and fosters the power of thinking for oneself, not being swayed by external sources. Seeing that, at this stage in our path, we’ve already realized so much, symbolized by the double illumination, we simply cannot integrate with others that well, even from within spiritual communities at times. The solitude deepens as we turn to the only satiating thing—that of our own pure presence and communion with 26 Creator, resting in the bosom of our awareness.",Hermit,IX,6,2,The Major Arcana
The Wheel,"We are reaping the rewards of our labor. Just as this wheel represents movement, and particularly movement with favorable connotations as influenced by Jupiter, we see the remnants of a Zodiac wheel. However, it is not the one we know of today. It is an ancient one, perhaps from distant pasts, where we have met ourselves in the same orientation on the wheel, but from either higher or lower on the cosmic horizon. This symbolizes cycles and favorable karmic implications, but each time we pass through it, we are reminded by the foreign zodiac of lessons and distant memories of times past. We have an opportunity at this junction to unite with all aspects of our soul and wisdom from ancient lifetimes. This is a moment in the journey that seems timeless, connecting both ancient past with future times. Access this 28 wisdom through a courageous heart, where living liquid plasma may be vortexed faster than the speed of light. The Divine lives in this sacred moment out of time.",Wheel,X,7,2,The Major Arcana
Strength,"Here you see a Jaguar Queen perched at the edge of the Aerthe using the sheer force of her mental faculties to conjure portals and bring to fruition the musings of her deep subconscious. We cannot make out whether the beasts coming from the portal of the infinite are friends or foes, yet she doesn’t waiver, displaying her mental and physical fortitude in her grounded footing. No matter what’s ahead of her, she is calm and poised, ready to face whatever it is. Ready to see what you’re made of? Or what you’re making? Either way, growth is occurring. Be careful not to force things with your willpower. You are being called into a higher expression of strength, one more feminine and allowing, not domineering reality. Instead of over-working, can you access flowstates more?",Strength,XI,6,2,The Major Arcana
The Hanged Man,"After fumbling around and trying to create using only sheer force and overpowering the situation, you finally are ready to “Let Go and Let God” as shown here in our Hanged Man. He is inverted but illuminated, showing that he has surrendered to The Divine and is now fully working in alignment with the pulse of consciousness that is igniting and connecting us all. This represents an exhale, where we allow and surrender to what is. We have done all the work, and we are tired of forcing. Now we surrender deeper into the more subtle Arcanum, aligning Head and Heart with the will of The Grand Beloved that some may call God. This is a time for releasing all attachments and expectations to outcomes and allowing the ‘co’ aspect of co-creation manifest its will and flow through you. Do you trust that you are held by the Grand Beloved? Can you surrender into 32 God’s will for you? How can you become more comfortable with the unknown?",Hanged Man,XII,5,2,The Major Arcana
The Unspoken,"Originally called “The Card With No Name”. In this rendition, you see a horse beast flying through the night, representing a Nightmare, or a mare running in the night. We don’t know why this mare is running. Did a gust of wind scare it, or was it due to its own other worldly connections? This card represents the first initiation on The Fool’s Journey, and that is one of The Unknown—the deep subconscious, the unspoken, that which we cannot see. Alluding to the feminine aspects with both symbolism of the Moon and the number 13, we could assume this horse is, in fact, a mare. This initiation allows us to feel an “external” force working against us. After many cards of accessing our divine spiritual power, we are now ready to be initiated deeper into our power by an unknown force majeure. Don’t shy away from such an 34 experience and shut down the light of your consciousness. Explore, learn and become curious once again! You are being offered a new beginning and it will serve you to tap into beginner’s mind.",Unspoken,XIII,8,2,The Major Arcana
Temperance,"Having been a bit too careless, we may have found ourselves allowing some laziness and darkness into our thoughts in the previous Arcana. Here is where we deepen our internal alchemical practice and learn to temper our emotional responses, yet again. We have accessed a deeper layer of our mental faculties, a layer that most do not ever get to even perceive. The currents are very subtle and move ever so slightly on the inner pendulum of emotion, yet at our current state of self-mastery, they cause potentially large swings in our external reality that reflect to us. As the alchemist grows, they must create spagyrics that are more and more refined as ‘less is more’ truly prevails in these settings. How can you find the middle path where you can distill the essence of your emotions to an even more refined decoction? Can you ease into 36 a middle path and yet access just as much joy in the simple satisfactions?",Temperance,XIV,8,2,The Major Arcana
The Adversary,"We may truly never know the fabric of what we’re made of without a good Adversary. In this card, traditionally known as The Devil, we see a powerful figure gazing ominously at us through a mask. We cannot tell who is truly behind such a mask, yet we assume outwardly that it is not of self. After all, every good hero needs a powerful Adversary. The Adversary represents the second initiation in The Fool’s Journey, where we’re faced with insurmountable obstacles. Whether emotional or earthly, this situation appears to be concrete and very solid. Upon further introspection, we see that The Adversary came in service to us all along. And in most cases, the astute sojourner can see how The Adversary and himself are one and the same. Again, call on your inner alchemical skillset to transmute this situation into fuel for your wildest dreams. In what ways 38 does the situation at hand serve you? Could you be your own worst enemy?",Adversary,XV,5,2,The Major Arcana
The House of God,"Whether we have successfully passed through the mastery portion of the previous card, realizing we are, in fact, our own adversary or not, this card comes to us as a stark reawakening. Your eyes, and especially your third-eye, can no longer stay closed to the light of cosmic and divine Truth that flow into them at increasing speeds. The river of information from the superhighway of nature and God flow into your crown, and if you attempt to shy away from it, destruction may occur. Allow this third initiation, however forceful it may feel, to catapult lower aspects of your ego out so only a solid foundation of authenticity may stand the test of time. When penetrated with the light of God, can you allow it to illuminate your own true nature? Are you clinging to aspects of yourself that are disingenuous? What are you being called to 40 allow to dissolve and soften into a more authentic version of yourself?",Tower,XVI,7,2,The Major Arcana
The Star,"Bravo! You have finally allowed the previous initiations to soften you, leaving only the supple undercurrents of your pure heart. Here you sit, in the fullness of both your expression and innocence. Take a moment to congratulate yourself and offer yourself the sweetest embrace of love! Not all who take the path of The Fool attain such sweet heights as to have landed at The Star. From this state of purity, you are born anew, and thus have the capacity to tap into new and unique solutions. Know you have already walked into the purifying fires and have become not only the Alchemist but the alchemy itself. It’s all within you at this point—indulge here in the suppleness of a clear North Star and inner gnosis. This is a card to celebrate your true nature. What things can you acknowledge and celebrate about yourself right now? How can you honor this delicate aspect of your own 42 innocence more?",Star,XVII,11,1,The Major Arcana
The Moon,"The final initiation on the journey of The Fool: we stare at a faceless Moon Goddess on a floating island. We cannot tell if it’s an illusion or if it is a being of this realm. The confusion leads us to reflect over our entire journey thus far. Has this construct we exist in, that protects us, and holds the soft insides of our existence even real? Is everything an illusion? Have we been in some sweet, timeless dream all along, or do the events that took place within this construct have their own tangible meaning? We are taken back to the primordial shores of our own emotions; can we read the currents of Truth in the waters within? What lessons does the construct offer us from each perspective? What can we learn from this current situation under both pretense of false and real? What would it mean if this situation was how you perceive it? Could it be another way? What 44 role do you play in the assessment of its validity?",Moon,XVIII,10,2,The Major Arcana
The Sun,"The twins stand so close, yet they are totally separated in different realms or dimensions. They are, however, also staring at seemingly the same Sun. The ultimate symbol for ‘As Above, So Below’ these two children do know of their connection, as they are still caught in duality, but with the light of their focus and attention, they are setting themselves on a course to transcend it. The small thin firmament that separates the two children is becoming thinner and thinner as the light of The Sun grows. And just like that, we too dissolve into Unity when the light of our awareness grows. Simultaneously, the Black Sun which represents our inner awareness rises and supersedes all external false idols, and we soon come to be consumed by the all-pervading force of this Clear Light of the Void. A moment of peace 46 engulfs us as we still the two minds and bring them into the harmonic resonance of unity.",Sun,XIX,10,2,The Major Arcana
Judgement,"Immediately following the spontaneous state of grace that was bestowed on The Fool in the previous card, the weight of his own responsibility falls on him all at once. Judgment comes swiftly, and “Ayni” or right relationship, must proceed. The Fool is offered a final opportunity to course correct nearly immediately in only such a way that Truth and love can guide, for he’s reached the heights of anointed illumination and the internal alchemical marriage. Now it is a sacred duty to make a judgment on oneself. With this comes the opportunity for responsibility for our creation. What will we choose? Will we take the Melchizedek vow and be of service till every aspect of our creation meets the light of the highest Truth and willingly joins The One? Will we dissolve into the abyss of unbridled bliss from whence we 48 came—Waheguru—once more? The choice is ok whether to stay and be of service or to dissolve back into The Divine. Only you will know.",Judgement,XX,9,3,The Major Arcana
The Realm,"Our beloved Fool has passed through all initiations, lessons and states of Grace bestowed to The Fool on our journey through the Major Arcana. You have passed and attained inner mastery. All the Arcana now are shown as feathers in your cap, and we pause here for a moment of stillness in celebration of your attainment of mastery. Illusions are shown clearly, with no fear and through the lens of the Most High. Rest deeply and firmly knowing that the world is, in fact, your entire projection and creation to steward. You are standing at the abyss where eternity intersects infinity and create at this point from the template of your truest song. The cymatics of your soul echo out into a blissful harmonic and form the realm as you 50 once knew it, at your command. From this place, you may boldly dream up a new realm to suit whatever expression your soul wishes to sing into existence. What new dreams are calling you? You know your power, go forth!",World,XXI,12,1,The Major Arcana
Ace of Cups,"A seed that will grow symbolizing new beginnings. Emotions start to take form from the depths of the uncharted territory of our subconscious. There is a fresh start, emotionally that softens the previous rigid structures of the mind. A new relationship may be appearing that will challenge all previous habits and tendencies. Much growth is promised should the querent maintain consciousness regarding the new waters.",Cups,Ace,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Two of Cups,"A new union is forming~ divine and aligned, an alchemical marriage of perfect polarities. There is a resonance between two, usually lovers, but can also be work or other types of partnerships. Conversely, it can also mean harmonization of the polarities within oneself. Think of an electrical circuit of liquid living plasma, flowing from resonant emotions creating cosmic connectivity. This is a highly auspicious card.",Cups,Two,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Three of Cups,"A celebration! It’s time to indulge in the highest of blissful and joyful vibrations amongst community and friends. If you’re attending a wedding or a festival remember it can be sweeter with a lover by your side. Conversely it can signify emotional release and creativity. Dance and make art! Find one thing you can celebrate about yourself, your community or your beloved at this very moment. You are the creator of the bliss that you seek!",Cups,Three,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Four of Cups,The exhale. Take a natural pause to integrate all the whirlwind of emotions that have come before. Settle into the emotional stability that comes from integration and take a pause for quiet time after intense bliss or emotional stir up. You are realizing that everything is coming to you that you’ve been manifesting. Now it is time to settle the waters of the mind to receive it all. Stabilization is needed. Work with the colors blue and gold surrounding you like an egg to help stabilize your emotional field.,Cups,Four,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Five of Cups,"The challenge/opportunity. The time is ripe for unprecedented growth! Alchemizing challenging situations into gold can prove to be an abundant fuel source for your dreams. This is an initiation phase, the moment you can capitulate yourself into a higher state. Learn to see the “challenge” at hand as an 54 opportunity. Extract the lessons as gold. You are growing, and these changes are your test!",Cups,Five,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Six of Cups,You have passed an alchemical initiation and are now learning how to thrive in higher emotional capacity in healthy ways. Your cup runneth over. You are giving and receiving love and care equally and exhibiting healthy boundaries. This is a performing phase where things are crystalizing into a positive flowstate.,Cups,Six,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Seven of Cups,"Your head is in the clouds, but that’s perfect because your feet are grounded steadily into reality. You are reflecting on your emotions and using them as an alchemical fuel to pour into your chalice as you create the next version of your dream of Heaven on Aerthe. Remember to breathe, you are continuously stepping into emotional mastery. Can you have more compassion with yourself?",Cups,Seven,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Eight of Cups,Another exhale. Gain perspective and take a pause to find and seek emotional depth from another vantage point. Challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone. In this phase you are fine-tuning your emotions by zooming out and getting a bird’s eye perspective. Ride the elevator of your consciousness a couple floors up to see a bigger picture.,Cups,Eight,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Nine of Cups,Drinking from your own chalice. Celebrate! You are seeing the fruits of your labor and here you are basking in the amrita of the Goddess of Love! The sweet nectar of emotional bliss that has come from your hard work and due diligence in perfecting yourself. Allow yourself to inhale all the sweetness of your labor and effort.,Cups,Nine,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Ten of Cups,"Cosmic Union. A transcendental experience of consciousness comes from either a Divine Union in the external in the form of a beloved, or from within, as in the cosmic alchemical marriage between the physical and etheric. You are vibrating and rippling out waves of radiant harmonic energy as a result of this attainment. You are giving healing and blessings to all who drink from your vibrational chalice overflowing with love. Be bliss!!! You have attained it!",Cups,Ten,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Child of Cups,"Return to the inner magick of your curiosity and invoke a childlike wonder. Look into your emotional instincts with the intention to discover from the eyes of a child. What can you learn about this situation and how can you understand your emotions even more deeply? From this new understanding about what makes you tick, can you tap into the magick of pure emotion to create something that exceeds your previous ceiling or cap of creative potential?",Cups,Child,2,12,The Royal Arcana
Knight of Cups,"Your armor stands before you as an obstacle to be overcome. Your own guard seems impenetrable, but it is merely an illusion, a mirage. It’s time to drop the guard and drop into your more tender side, giving and receiving love and truly delighting in the suppleness that vulnerability begets. The most courageous expression at times is when we allow ourselves to be most tender. Harness this aspect of the divine masculine; that of gentleness and compassion as well as sensitivity.",Cups,Knight,2,12,The Royal Arcana
Queen of Cups,"Our Queen of the sacred waters balances the nine cups in perfect harmony, but in fact there are ten! This symbolizes Godly union and emotional harmony and maturity. The tenth cup is not visible, but it is the grail cup within her. The most feminine of all the Minor Arcana, this card comes to us as a reminder of divine feminine powers of juggling both compassion and Truth while maintaining 58 complete control and balance of our inner emotional state. We see clearly, yet we act from a place of stability. Our roots trace back to the beginning of time rooted in the wisdom of our ancestors.",Cups,Queen,2,12,The Royal Arcana
King of Cups,"Our noble King of the calm waters comes to us as a symbol of diplomacy, calmness and gentleness in conflict and inner or outer composure. This card offers you a unique vantage point to your emotions, rising above them and calming the internal waters. We approach and channel our emotions through the prism of the upward facing pyramid, referencing the divine masculine, so we are being firm, yet compassionate. We are navigating our lives in a way that illuminates both Truth and our deep emotional intuition.",Cups,King,2,12,The Royal Arcana
Ace of Wands,"A new beginning is here! A creative spark has ignited you and propelled you on a new path in a direction full of magick, hope and promise. Follow your passion and your most authentic motivations to wield your wand accordingly. This is the equivalent to the sperm fertilizing the egg before the zygote forms. Follow this motivation to see what action steps can follow for your highest destiny.",Wands,Ace,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Two of Wands,"This represents two distinct paths you can take. Only that still small voice inside you knows what the right path may be. Beyond that there is a more elevated option, where the choice is not between only two paths, but rather the idea of destiny and the concept of creatorhood. On the 60 one path, you are a victim to external situations, while on the other, you are taking responsibility for your thoughts and creations. Should you choose the latter path, spend sixty seconds right now immersing yourself in the feeling you get when the situation you desire most comes to fruition. Rejoice in all the bounteous feelings and manifest destiny.",Wands,Two,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Three of Wands,"This represents the path of creatorship. Even though you can’t see the full story, how the magick unfolds or even the magical tips of two of these wands; you are centered in your creation and ready at the helm. Symbolizing unity of the left-hand and the right-hand path, you find yourself in a place of neutrality, actively creating your own way.",Wands,Three,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Four of Wands,"You are shattering a ceiling you previously were unable to breach and have achieved a major breakthrough. By watching your thoughts, you 61 can create beyond what you think you are capable of achieving simply by holding the compass of your thoughts steadily pointed due north in the direction of your highest calling, purpose and desires. Align your head with your heart and witness your inner warrior fight the battles against baseline programs. Victoriously your warrior of presence will expel any implantations that are not in service to your highest calling. Stay steady on the course to victory.",Wands,Four,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Five of Wands,"Chaos? Look deeper, it is merely the casting of your innermost thoughts. Have you gotten sloppy in your presence and housekeeping of your thoughts? Are those subconscious programs of lack, failure, etc. still programming reality and reflecting conflict and struggle back to you in your life? Relax. Get centered. Let the light of your consciousness pierce through the sigils your thoughts have cast, undoing them and redoing them with the full power of your 62 Soul’s desire. Recommended to start a meditation practice of simple vipassana. Observe your breath.",Wands,Five,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Six of Wands,"Rejoice! It is only by your dedication to your inner sanctum and your commitment to keeping your headspace pristine that you receive this victory. The wands reflect connection to your emotional state as well as the stillness of the eternal void. The action of paying close attention has formed the most intricate tools by which to create even more magick. Take this time to celebrate and acknowledge how far you come, it is an essential and crucial part of your integration process. What accomplishment can you celebrate at this moment, right now?",Wands,Six,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Seven of Wands,"At first glance, the odds seem stacked against you, the obstacles insurmountable as you begin the treacherous ascent up the post. Do not waiver. This is a test where you discover what 63 you're made of... what is the boundary of where my creation ends, and destiny begins? Will you attain the jewel which resides in the consciousness of the Most High? The choice is yours, but do not forget to zoom out and get perspective of how close you are. You have already climbed to the heights of insurmountable obstacles. Don’t give up now, you are so close.",Wands,Seven,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Eight of Wands,You have cleared obstacles and created space for laser sharp focus. Aligned actions as a result of being in touch with your deep emotions have created a vehicle for you to soar toward your goals. You have renewed vitality and boundless energy that only comes from a well-rounded clarity. You are exhibiting integrity with your actions and emotions being in alignment. The circuit is complete in your energy field. Take flight!,Wands,Eight,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Nine of Wands,"The harvest of your alchemical garden is upon you. It is wise to refrain from starting brand new projects. Instead, complete and integrate what projects you have already begun. There is so much in your garden that is already ripe and ready for your enjoyment. Celebrate, integrate and feel satiated with the fruits of your labor. If some loose ends remain, polish them up and tie things down. Discover what messages are inscribed along the stones of the path that you took to get to where you are, decode the hidden messages. There is much more to learn from this accomplishment.",Wands,Nine,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Ten of Wands,"A new beginning of something already in your life. Take clear action steps that can bring new life to a project previously started. Time is cyclical and just as the sky clock rotates in 360 degrees, so does time. It also follows either an upward or downward spiral, depending on your thoughts. This shows a higher dimensional 65 octave of a previous project or situation in your life, in a higher timeframe. You are creating a new beginning. Alignment and ascending progress await as our journey continues.",Wands,Ten,1,40,The Minor Arcana
Child of Wands,"Delight in the magick around you! Call upon the magick of nature to inspire new creative ways to move in life.
